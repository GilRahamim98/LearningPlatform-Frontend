## Development Server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building
To build the project, run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the dist/ directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
